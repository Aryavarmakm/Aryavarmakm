## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Olympic medal outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. We explore different classifiers and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective approach for predicting whether a country will win a medal based on historical data.

## Algorithms Used
The project utilizes the following machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.
3. **Decision Tree**: A non-parametric model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules from data features.
4. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes.
5. **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor's errors.
6. **Neural Network**: A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of neurons that can capture complex patterns in data.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This section involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform EDA to understand the data distribution and relationships between different features.
3. **Model Implementation**: Here, we implement the above-mentioned algorithms and tune hyperparameters to optimize their performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.
5. **Results**: A comparison of the models based on their performance metrics and a discussion on the best performing model.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Google Colab**: Open the Google Colab notebook linked [ https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mMX03wWnrmIeZdYuLcUwu8_tteRE600-?authuser=1#scrollTo=zl3u97MGR4jN&printMode=true](#). Ensure you have a Google account to access the notebook.
2. **Data Loading**: The dataset will be loaded directly from a CSV file hosted in a public repository.
3. **Dependencies**: The notebook installs all necessary libraries, including `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `tensorflow`. You can also manually install them using:
    ```python
    !pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
    ```
4. **Execution**: Run each cell sequentially to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical Olympic data, including features like country, year, number of athletes, GDP, and past medal counts.

## Results
The performance of each algorithm is documented in detail in the notebook. In general, ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed well, while the Neural Network model captured complex patterns in the data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting Olympic medal outcomes. Future improvements could involve using more advanced techniques, such as deep learning models, or expanding the dataset with additional features.
